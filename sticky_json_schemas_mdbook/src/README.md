# Introduction

## what is stickyschema?
stickyschema, is my playground project to learn more about json schemas and bring more structure to some of my apps.
<br/>
this is not meant to be taken as a dependable standard.

## Creating your first schema
ℹ️ [https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step)

schema definition
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://stickyschema.near.near.page/example/example.schema.json",
  "title": "Example",
  "description": "An example schema",
  "..." : "..."
}
```
see [array/](./array/), for a sample basic schema
